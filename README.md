Explorer is a series of different projects I’m building to learn web development from HTML and CSS to JS and ReactJS whilst also practicing UX/UI design and accessibility concepts.
It’s one of the courses offered by [rocketseat.com.br](https://rocketseat.com.br)

### Project 05
In this project I've explored the CSS flexbox and how to build a home screen with cards that are aligned taking into account the size of the screen and how many cards there are.

You can access the final result [here](https://dadaniela.github.io/explorer-project5/)
